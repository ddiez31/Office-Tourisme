#About the project

This project aims to allow anybody to browse a map with markers on it. 
By clicking on a marker, the user can see pictures and a description of this location.
The user can also directly browse a picture gallery.
The map can be displayed in full-screen.

```
browser-sync start --server --files "*/*.*"
``` 

The site will then open in your default browser.
